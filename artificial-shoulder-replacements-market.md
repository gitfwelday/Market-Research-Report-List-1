<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Shoulder Replacements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Prostheses</li><li>Uncemented Prostheses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial shoulder replacements market consists of cemented and uncemented prostheses. Cemented prostheses utilize a bone cement to bond the implant securely to the bone, providing immediate stability and strength, making them ideal for older patients with weaker bone quality. In contrast, uncemented prostheses use a porous surface to encourage natural bone growth into the implant, promoting biological fixation. This type is often preferred for younger, more active patients with healthier bone density, allowing for greater longevity and mobility.</p></p>
